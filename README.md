## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1.  Ensure HACS is installed.
2.  In Home Assistant, go to **HACS > Integrations > Click the 3 dots in the top right > Custom Repositories**.
3.  Enter `https://github.com/StannyByte/HomeAssistant-Videoloft` as the repository URL, select `Integration` as the category, and click **Add**.
4.  The `HomeAssistant-Videoloft` integration will now appear. Click **Install** and follow the prompts.
5.  Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/StannyByte/HomeAssistant-Videoloft/releases).
2.  Copy the `videoloft` folder from the downloaded archive into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
3.  Restart Home Assistant.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1.  After installation and restarting Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
2.  Click the **+ Add Integration** button in the bottom right.
3.  Search for **Videoloft** and select it.
4.  Enter your Videoloft username and password when prompted.
5.  The integration will automatically discover your cameras and associated LPR sensors.
6.  Access the custom panel by clicking on **Videoloft Cams** in the Home Assistant sidebar.

> **No YAML needed for integration setup!**
> All core integration configuration is handled via the Home Assistant UI. Panel-specific settings (like the Gemini API key) are managed within the panel itself.

## üß† How It Works

- **Core Integration:**
  - **Camera Entities:** Creates standard Home Assistant `camera` entities. These provide HLS stream sources (`stream_source`) for live viewing and snapshot capabilities (`async_camera_image`).
  - **LPR Sensor Entities:** If LPR is enabled on your Videoloft account, `sensor` entities are created to report the latest LPR event data, enabling powerful automations.
  - **API Communication:** Securely communicates with the Videoloft API to fetch camera lists, stream URLs, and LPR data.

- **Custom Panel (`Videoloft Cams`):**
  - **Rich UI:** Provides an advanced user interface for interacting with your cameras and features.
  - **HLS Player:** Utilizes HLS.js for robust video streaming with custom controls.
  - **LPR Management:** Connects via WebSocket to stream LPR logs in real-time and manage LPR triggers.
  - **AI Search Interface:** Facilitates interaction with the Google Gemini API for event analysis and search.

---

## üé¨ Usage Examples

### Viewing Live Streams
- Navigate to the **Videoloft Cams** panel from the sidebar. The **Live** tab will display all your camera streams.
- Alternatively, add individual camera entities to your Home Assistant dashboards for standard viewing.

### Creating LPR Automations
- Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes** in Home Assistant.
- Create a new automation, using the **State** of an LPR sensor (e.g., `sensor.videoloft_lpr_matched_event`) as a trigger.
- Example: If the state of `sensor.videoloft_lpr_matched_event` changes, turn on the driveway light.

### Using AI Search
1.  In the **Videoloft Cams** panel, go to the **AI Search** tab.
2.  Enter and save your Google Gemini API key.
3.  Select a camera and run the task.
4.  Type your natural language query (e.g., "person wearing a blue jacket") and click search.
